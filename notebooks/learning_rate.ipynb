    "To solve the problem of the learning rate: stepwise plan\n",
    "1) according to empirical testing: example for a parent rock volume of 10e9 the optimal learning rate is 1000, for PRV of 10e8, 10000 when the parent rock decreases with factor 10 the learning rate increases by factor 10. A constant value: PRV * learning rate can be introduced and is a constant value for a given pluton we will name this \"pluton_learningrate\"\n",
    "2) Now we need to find a correlation between the mean grainsize with this value so a function ie : pluton_grainsize = ... * mean grainsize +/- ... or even higher grade correlations which will be assessed by plots\n",
    "3) when this formula is enstated we should be able to recalculate based on the grainsize, the \"pluton_learningrate\" and recalculate the optimal learning rate for different parent rock volumes"
